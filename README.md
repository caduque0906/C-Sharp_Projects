# C-Sharp_Projects
These are basic projects I made using C# and .NET Framework

### Projects:

+ [Car Insurance](https://github.com/caduque0906/C-Sharp_Projects/tree/main/CarInsurance)

### Car Insurance
This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes the user's input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. There is also an admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.
